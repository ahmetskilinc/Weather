# Weather App!

Simple weather app design using SwiftUI and MapKit.

Using dummy data at the moment. Was planning on using Darksky but after it got acquired by Apple that isn't possible. 😅

# What I learned:
- Some Swiftui basics for layout and design
- First time using MapKit

# Todo:
- Learn how to add API backend in swift.
- Add API backend to make it dynamic.
